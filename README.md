### Things to keep in mind

- Kubernetes YAML syntax and API versions sometimes change (e.g., extensions/v1beta1 → apps/v1). Easy fixes with updated docs.

- HashiCorp tooling: Nomad and Consul adoption has plateaued a bit compared to Kubernetes + Envoy/Istio. Still worth understanding, but you might supplement with CNCF-native equivalents.

- Go itself evolves slowly (Go 1.16 → Go 1.23), so language examples from 2021 are still fine.
